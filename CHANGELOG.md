# Release 0.4.7

## What's Improved

- In the last version, Cloudflare Captcha can not display properly because of security policies. In this version, the security policies has changed to looser to fix that.
- Change the UserAgent from default to Edge 121 so users can get more chat logs.
- the link of the repository has changed to [https://github.com/fangkehou-team/BingGPT_Enhanced_Editon](https://github.com/fangkehou-team/BingGPT_Enhanced_Editon)

## What's Broken

- All the Keyboard Shortcuts, Export, Font Size settings are broken due to `iframe`. Maybe next version I will change the `iframe` to `BrowserView`, or maybe next time, next next time......

## What Changed

- Nothing. All users can update seamlessly

## What Needs Help

- Nope, but if you can help me with the broken part of this repo, I will be grateful.
