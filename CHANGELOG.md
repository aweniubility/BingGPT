# Release 0.4.5

It may be the last version of the BingGPT 0.4.x. Unless Microsoft updates the logic of this part, I will not continue to spend a lot of time on this project.

## What's Improved

- Login problem solved.

## What's Broken

- All the Keyboard Shortcuts, Export, Font Size settings are broken due to `iframe`. Maybe next version I will change the `iframe` to `BrowserView`, or maybe next time, next next time......

## What Changed

- Nothing. All users can update seamlessly

## What Needs Help

- Nope, but if you can help me with the broken part of this repo, I will be grateful.

If you can help me improve this app, Please contribute to this repository! Pull Request and Issue is welcome.
